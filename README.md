# US with German umlauts

A macOS keyboard layout with easy accessible German umlauts.

## Keyboard modifications

This is the standard US keyboard layout with some changes to make German umlauts more accessible. 
The following keys have been modified:

| Key combination        | US standard           | US with German umlauts  |
| ---------------------- |:---------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| `⌥ + A`              | å                     | ä                       |
| `⌥ + O`              | ø                     | ö                       |
| `⌥ + U`              | ¨ (Dead key)          | ü                       |
| `⌥ + shift + A`      | Å                     | Ä                       |
| `⌥ + shift + O`      | Ø                     | Ö                       |
| `⌥ + shift + U`      | ¨                     | Ü                       |
| `⌥ + 2`              | ™                     | €                       |
| `⌥ + l`              | ¬                     | @                       |

## Installation

1. Download `us-with-german-umlauts.bundle` and move it into `~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/` or `/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts`.
1. Logout and login again and select the layout in the keyboard system preferences (english language).
1. Sometimes it can happen that the keyboard layout is shown twice in the keyboard selection pane. In this case only one of them works properly (for me the one at the end of the list).
